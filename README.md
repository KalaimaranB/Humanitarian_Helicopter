## Notes

Please note the overall summaries were generated by ai, but were fact checked for accuracy. The purpose of this readme is to simply provide a general overview of what the game did and my programming style. This projected was completed prior to CPEN 221 (a course dedicatd to programming in Java and good software practices), and so may not follow all best principles. It does however help establish my thought process and general game design.
